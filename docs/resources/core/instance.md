## Instance Reference
* `availability_domain` - The Availability Domain the instance is running in.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the instance.
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
* `id` - The OCID of the instance.
* `image_id` - The image used to boot the instance. You can enumerate all available images by calling ListImages.
* `state` - The current state of the instance: [PROVISIONING, RUNNING, STARTING, STOPPING, STOPPED, CREATING_IMAGE, TERMINATING, TERMINATED]
* `metadata` - Custom metadata that you provide.
* `extended_metadata` - Custom nested metadata that you provide.
* `region` - The region that contains the Availability Domain the instance is running in.
* `shape` - The shape of the instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance.
* `time_created` - The date and time the instance was created.
